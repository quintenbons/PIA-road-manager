# AI project: road management

## Quick start

`./main.py`

## Structure

- [examples/](./examples/): Examples and tests of simple sample usecases
- [src/](./src/)
    - [strategy](./src/strategy.py): AI strategy (TO START)
    - [engine/](./src/engine/): Engine only, try to keep this standalone so we can simulate without graphics too
    - [graphics/](./src/graphics/): All pygame related stuff, meaning it will rely on the engine
